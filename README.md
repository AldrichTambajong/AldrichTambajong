- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AldrichTambajong
I'm a computer science major at Georgia State University. I love playing laser tag, go karting,and going out to EAT, 
especially with friends in and out of school. Coding is real dear to me because it was the first time I felt really engaged
in academic learning and it was so cool to sort of think outside the box to develop programs for assignments. Not to mention 
that ultimate bliss of seeing a, relatively large, program work the way you want it and those small reliefs of creating and revising
the small problems to make the entire program work.
